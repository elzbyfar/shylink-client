## Description

This is a url shortener. On the client end we have React and a responsive CSS design. The back end is a Ruby on Rails API with PostgreSQL. The short URLs are stored in the database and consist of the base url (https://shylink.herokuapp.com) followed by a random hexanumeeric code or a user-generated custom slug.
